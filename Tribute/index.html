                <h2>First Indian Women to fly to Space</h2>
                <p><b>Kalpana Chawla </b>(17 March 1962 - 1 February 2003) was an Indian-born American astronaut and aerospace engineer who was the first woman of Indian origin to fly to space.[3][4] She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator.[5]

                    Chawla's second flight was on STS-107, the final flight of Columbia, in 2003. She was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003.[6] Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor,[7] and several streets, universities, and institutions have been named in her honor.</p>

                    <h3>Biography :</h3>
                        <br><br>
                 <dd><b>Early Life and Childhood</b></dd>
                    <dl>In the Indian state of Haryana, in the little town of Karnal, Kalpana Chawla was born. She was the youngest of four siblings and was raised in a humble home. From an early age, Kalpana showed a strong interest in flying and the sky. She loved watching airplanes and often did so in amazement, fantasizing about one day being a pilot herself. Kalpana persevered in her goals despite certain gender barriers she encountered when considering an aviation career.

                        The University of Texas in Austin granted her a second Master in Mechanical Engineering. When NASA chose her as an astronaut candidate in 1994, her aspirations came true. Kalpana Chawla was the first Indian-born woman to travel into space when she went on mission STS-87 of the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997, following extensive training and preparation.
                        
                        From her early years in Karnal to her success as an astronaut, Kalpana's career was a monument to her tenacity and love of exploration. Many others, especially aspiring women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, continue to find inspiration in her life and achievements. Kalpana Chawla's life was tragically cut short on February 1, 2003, when the Space Shuttle Columbia exploded during re-entry, but her legacy endures as a testament to human inventiveness and the pursuit of unattainable goals.</dl>
                        <br><br>
                        <dd><b>Education</b></dd>
                        <dl>Chawla went to Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School in Karnal for her primary and secondary schooling in India. NASA encouraged the school to participate in their Summer Space Experience Program after Chawla went on to become a NASA astronaut. Chawla was adamant about ensuring that young women in India had access to scientific education.

                            Punjab Engineering College awarded Chawla an aeronautical engineering degree. Professors attempted to discourage her from choosing the degree since there were few options for females in India who wanted to pursue this career route. This was a point of contention, but Chawla refused to budge. Emigrating from India to the United States in the 1980s, Chawla was granted naturalization to complete her education. She's been an aeronautical engineer at the University of Colorado when she earned her master's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2005. Additionally, she began researching fluid mechanics for lifting systems at NASA Ames Research Center the following year.</dl>

                           <dd><b>Career as an Astronaut</b></dd> 
                           <dl>She started working at NASA Ames Research Center in 1988, where she studied computational fluid dynamics for motorized lifts. She focused on modeling complicated airflows found near aircraft, especially the Harrier, in "ground impact." Since joining Overset Methods Inc. in 1993, Kalpana Chawla has worked with other researchers to develop a team focusing on modeling situations involving numerous moving bodies. Aerodynamic optimization methods were developed and implemented by her. The findings of her study have been published in technical publications and conference papers.
                            NASA chose her in December 1994, and she began working for the agency in January 1995. Her name was called to the attention of the Johnson Space Center as a candidate for the role of an astronaut when the 15th Group of Astronauts was created in March 1995. She had to complete one full year of training to become an Astronaut Office EVA/Robotics and Computer Branch Crew Representative. Here, she evaluated software for the space shuttles and worked with Robotic Situation Awareness Displays.</dl>
